# yt-dlp-update-downloads.txt
### Description
This tool updates your downloads.txt that ytl-dlp generates to track what videos you have already downloaded.

The downloads.txt file generated by yt-dlp and youtube-dl (now deprecated) only appends new youtube videos downloaded. It does not remove videos if you edit and remove youtube videos from your local Youtube collection.

This script aims to search through your local youtube file collection and update your downloads.txt file to reflect the current state of your Youtube collection to optimize yt-dlp's download speed and capability.

## Requirements
- You must adhere to  a youtube filename standard convention. Every youtube file must have the unique youtube video url GUID at the end of the file name within square brackets.
Example: "Random Music Lofi Mixtape [fn324f2389fnj23].mkv"
Where "fn324f2389fnj23" is the unique url GUID.
- Python 3.10.x or 3.11.x
